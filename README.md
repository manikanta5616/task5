Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic Dataset as part of Task 5 for the Customized Music Experience mini-project.
 Project Overview
Objective:
Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies within the Titanic dataset, using Python-based data science tools.

Deliverables:

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

PDF Report

PowerPoint Presentation (.pptx)

 Tools and Technologies
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

 EDA Process
Data inspection using .info(), .describe(), .value_counts()

Visualization techniques:

sns.pairplot() for feature relationships

sns.heatmap() for correlation analysis

Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots

Identifying missing values, trends, and anomalies

Observations and summary insights for modeling

 Key Findings
Missing data primarily in Age and Cabin columns.

Strong correlation between Pclass and Fare.

Higher survival rate among women and younger passengers.

Socioeconomic status (Pclass) strongly affected survival chances.
